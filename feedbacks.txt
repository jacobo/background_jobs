More explicitly say:
  this is our problem
  this is what we tried
  this is why it's a failure

focus on the big idea

explicitly say: jobs that rely on other jobs sucks

monitoring processes is hard (and graceful restart)

it would seem resque forks to make it easier to restart, maybe it makes it harder?

don't use delayed_job it kills your database
  (picture of Evan)

more time to stop and summarize

show a timeline as we go?

explicitly say
  we've regressed on daemonization and reliability
    because resque it popular?

missing from my custom Q, graceful restart

mention Q-classic?

Josh:
  it's about recording intent vs. recording actions

explicit: AMQP / rabbit are the same thing

no question marks
